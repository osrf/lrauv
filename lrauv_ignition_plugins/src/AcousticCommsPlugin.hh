/// \brief 
/// * `<address>` : The address parameter. This is a 32 bit unsigned int which
/// reflects the address which belongs to this vehicle. This will also create 
/// the topics  `/comms/external/<address>/rx` on which this plugin will publish
/// received messages and `/comms/external/<address>/tx` which this plugin 
/// subscribes to and publishes data.
/// * `<model_plugin_file>` : This is the name of library containing the 
/// environmental comms Plugin. The file should be in your `$TETHYS_COMMS_MODEL`
/// directory [Required].
/// * `<model_name>` : This is the name of the environmental communications 
/// model. [Required]
/// * `<link_name>` : The link to which the wireless transponder is attached
/// to. [Required]
/// * `<external_comms_prefix>` : Prefix on which to handle interaction between
/// the application . [Optional, Defaults to `/comms/external`]
/// * `<internal_comms_prefix>` : Prefix on which to send and listen for
/// internal packets.  [Optional, Defaults to `/comms/internal`]
/// * `<broadcast>` : This defaults to true. When enabled all receivers will
/// receive all packets. If false, then packets will be directed only to 
/// specified receivers.  [Optional, Defaults to `/comms/internal`]
/// * `<timestep>` : If defined this will allow the comms client to run at a
/// higher clock resolution than the physics engine. This is useful when dealing
/// with ranging. If the timestep is set larger than the physics engine dt then
/// the engine will default to dt. Note: for consistency it is adviced that the
/// dt is a multiple of timestep. [Optional. Seconds]
